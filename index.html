        <h2>Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> was the founder of the Maratha Empire. He was born in the Shivneri Fort in
          Maharashtra probably on 19 February 1630. He is named after a local goddess, Shivai Devi.

          Chh.Shivaji Maharaj is one of the revered historical figures of Maharashtra. He created an independent and
          sovereign state in the Maharashtra region. His mother, Raajmaata Jijabai was the daughter of Shri.Lakhuji
          Jadhavrao of Sindkhed. His father Shri.Shahajiraje Bhosale was a Maratha general in the Deccan.

          Most of the territory in Maharashtra was then under the possession of the Nizamshah of Ahmednagar and the
          Adilshah of Bijapur who were known as the Deccan sultanates. The Mughals launched a campaign to conquer the
          Nizamshahi Kingdom. The Adilshah of Bijapur allied with the Mughals in this campaign. Shri. Shahajiraje
          Bhosale tried to rebel, but he could not withstand the combined might of the Mughals and the Adilshahi. The
          Nizamshahi kingdom came to an end in 1636. Thereafter Shri.Shahajiraje became a Sardar of the Adilshah of
          Bijapur and was posted in Karnataka. The region comprising Pune, Supe, Indapur, and Chakan Parganas located
          between the Bhima and Nira rivers which were vested in Shri. Shahajiraje as a jagir was continued by the
          Adilshah. Shri. Shahajiraje was also given a jagir of Bangalore. Raajmata Jijabai and Chh. Shivaji Maharaj,
          stayed for a few years with Shri.Shahajiraje at Bangalore until Chh. Shivaji Maharaj was twelve years old.
          Shri. Shahaji entrusted the administration of the Lakshmi jagir to Chh.Shivaji and Mata Jijabai. Chh. Shivaji
          grew up amidst the hills and valleys of the Pune region under the guidance of his mother Raajmata Jijabai. His
          mother taught him the stories of the Hindu epics and scriptures such as Mahabharata and also stories of old
          mighty Hindu kingdoms such as the Vijayanagara. He was also trained in guerrilla warfare. He defeated the
          Mughal forces of Rai Bagan.
